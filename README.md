## ![](readme_images/cabfarecalculator-icon-small.png) Cab Fare Calculator
### Description
Iâ€™m bad at working out quickly how much to tip a cab driver in my head, and just as bad at working how much to ask for in change if I give them the fare in dollar notes.

This Shortcut provides a Today widget to calculate the tip for you, telling you how much to give the driver in $10 increments and how much to ask back for in change.

## ![](readme_images/bixi-icon-small.png) Bixi
### Description
Locates the nearest Montreal [Bixi](http://bixi.com) dock in your Today Widget, and tells you how many bikes and free docks are available. Optionally, it will also provide walking or cycling directions.

I created this because sometimes you know the area and just want to see at a glance which cross-street the nearest station is at, and whether you could dock your bike there.
