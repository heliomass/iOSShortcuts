# iOS Workflows
A collection of workflows for [Workflow App](https://workflow.is).

## MTL Cab Fare Calculator
### Description
I’m bad at working out quickly how much to tip a cab driver in my head, and just as bad at working how much to ask for in change if I give them the fare in dollar notes.

This workflow provides a Today widget will calculate the tip for you, telling you how much to give the driver in $10 increments and how much to ask back for in change.

## MTL Metro Status

### Installation
You can install the workflow by downloading the `.wflow` file directly from this repository.

### Issues
I have chosen not to add this workflow to the official gallery at this time, due to a severe bug with the current version of Workflow (v1.4.1).

When the Metro status contains too much content, the Today widget will freeze, and the only workaround right now is to restart the phone.

The Workflow development team have been informed of the issue, and given the severity of the bug we can but hope it will be addressed in their next release.
