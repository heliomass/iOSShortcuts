A collection of workflows for [Workflow App](https://workflow.is).

## MTL Cab Fare Calculator
### Description
I’m bad at working out quickly how much to tip a cab driver in my head, and just as bad at working how much to ask for in change if I give them the fare in dollar notes.

This Shortcut provides a Today widget will calculate the tip for you, telling you how much to give the driver in $10 increments and how much to ask back for in change.

## Nearest Bixi Dock
### Description
Locates the nearest [Bixi](http://bixi.com) dock in your Today Widget, and tells you how many bikes and free docks are available. Optionally, it will also provide walking or cycling directions.

I created this because sometimes you know the area and just want to see at a glance which cross-street the nearest station is at, and whether you could dock your bike there.

This widget is powered by [Bixi Time](http://bixitime.com). You can get the source code for Bixi Time [here](https://github.com/euoia/bixitime-website).

### Installation

Maps default to Google Maps to display the route to the nearest dock, but you can change the app in the workflow itself towards the bottom.
