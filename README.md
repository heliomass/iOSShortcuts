# iOS Workflows
A collection of workflows for [Workflow App](https://workflow.is).

## MTL Cab Fare Calculator
### Description
Iâ€™m bad at working out quickly how much to tip a cab driver in my head, and just as bad at working how much to ask for in change if I give them the fare in dollar notes.

This workflow provides a Today widget will calculate the tip for you, telling you how much to give the driver in $10 increments and how much to ask back for in change.

## Stache
### Description
For some reason, [Stache](http://getstache.com) doesn't provide access via the iOS share sheet when using Chrome. This workflow provides the missing functionality. To use choose "Share" in Chrome, then "Run Workflow" from the share sheet and finally "Stache".
